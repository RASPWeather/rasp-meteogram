# rasp-meteogram
RASP Meteogram for a spot location

This is a pull from https://gitlab.com/HenrikBengtsson/blipmaps.nl, specifically: https://gitlab.com/HenrikBengtsson/blipmaps.nl/-/blob/master/meteogram.ncl

It includes minor modifications to permit British units (Feet, Knots and Celcius) and the clock processing time on print statements to the console.

Thanks to the original authors retained inside the header of the NCL script: T J Olney, Tonino Tarsi and Henrik Bengtsson (for the Dutch adjustments).

Live output of the code can be found here: https://rasp.stratus.org.uk/index.php/meteograms
